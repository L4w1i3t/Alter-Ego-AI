    "knownIssues": [
        "- The program does not currently have voice recognition implementation.",
        "- When using the Ollama model, responses can sometimes repeat or become incoherent from memory retrieval. This is an issue with the model itself, not with the algorithm.",
        "- Seeing as how as of 2/17/2025 the program is going through a massive backend overhaul, the following features are temporarily removed: long-term memory, short-term memory",
        "- Due to a new implementation of ElevenLabs and currently using a naive approach to TTS to test the waters, the generated audio lags behind the text output.",
        "- Emotion detection, due to learning the Huggingface js library right now, only shows one emotion at a time. This will be fixed in a future update."
