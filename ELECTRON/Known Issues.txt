Need to implement memory (working, short-term, and long-term). There should be two memory systems: robotic and humanlike, the former being very algorithmic that stores EVERYTHING into memory, and the letter being exactly that, where it operates with human psychology.

Continuous speech recognition/STT still needs to be implemented. I do not want to use any paid API's for this feature; everything should be local.
