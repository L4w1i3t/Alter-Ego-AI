ALTER EGO is a digital interactive AI interface that allows you to converse and communicate with a replication of any personality you so desire. It blends speech recognition, dynamic text and voice generation, and matching avatars to maximize the user experience. This program utilizes OpenAI GPT and Whisper, Ollama, ElevenLabs, and roberta-base go_emotions technologies in order to bring characters and personas to life.

***CURRENT VERSION: Pre-alpha***

## About ALTER EGO

ALTER EGO is an AI platform that transforms the way you interact with digital personas. By harnessing cutting-edge technologies in natural language processing and speech recognition, it enables you to have immersive conversations with any personalityâ€”be it historical figures, fictional characters, or entirely original creations.

---

## Features

- **Customizable Personalities**: Create and interact with AI-driven personalities that mimic the speech patterns, knowledge, and behaviors of any character you choose. Results may vary.

- **Language Model Selection**: Be able to chose which language models to use in your interactions on startup, between OpenAI and Ollama. The former requires
an API key and costs on a per-token basis, but is noticeable more robust. The latter is open-source and zero-cost, but requires external setup and is
more limited in its responses.

- **Advanced Speech Recognition**: Utilize OpenAI Whisper for accurate and real-time voice input processing.

- **Realistic Voice Generation**: Experience lifelike voice responses generated by ElevenLabs' state-of-the-art text-to-speech technology.

- **Emotion Detection and Response**: Employ the roberta-base go_emotions open-source model to detect emotional cues and generate contextually appropriate responses.

- **Dynamic Avatars**: Engage with matching avatars that visually represent the personalities, enhancing the conversational experience.

- **Seamless Integration**: Built to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new features and integration with other platforms.

## Setup

Currently, ALTER EGO is in the early stages of development and is not publicly available for general use. If you're interested in exploring the project or contributing to its development, you are welcome to clone the repository and set it up yourself. Please note that this program requires:

- **Technical Expertise**: Familiarity with Python, language models, and API integrations.
- **API Access**: Valid API keys for OpenAI and ElevenLabs.
- **An Ollama Distribution**: Have Ollama correctly set up on your system.
- **Hardware Requirements**: A capable system that can handle the computational load, preferably with GPU support. A full breakdown of recommended hardware will come in a future update after significant testing.

Please note that for language models, you will absolutely need the setup for either OpenAI or Ollama to use the program. The API keys are not required to
run the program, but they are needed to run their respective services.

## Usage

Once you have the system set up, you can start using ALTER EGO as follows:

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the main script to start the interface.

2. **Select or Create a Personality**:
   - Choose from pre-built personalities OR
   - Customize or create a new persona by defining attributes, knowledge base, and behavioral patterns.

3. **Initiate Conversation**:
   - Use your microphone to speak naturally OR
   - Type your message for the program to respond.

4. **Receive Responses**:
   - ALTER EGO generates a context-aware response using a language model.
   - The response is vocalized through ElevenLabs' voice synthesis.
   - An avatar displays appropriate expressions based on the emotional context.

5. **Continue Interaction**:
   - Engage in an ongoing dialogue.
   - The program adapts to the conversation flow and emotional cues.

## Known Issues

- ALTER EGO will sometimes crash when using speech recognition.
- The ElevenLabs API can be slow to respond, causing delays in voice synthesis.
- Chat History does not function when using OpenAI.
- Error text appears if ElevenLabs audio is enabled but there are no voice models. Happens on startup.

**If new issues are found, please open an issue on the repository.**
