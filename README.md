ALTER EGO is a digital interactive AI interface that allows you to converse and communicate with a replication of any personality you so desire. It blends speech recognition, dynamic text and voice generation, and matching avatars to maximize the user experience. This program utilizes OpenAI GPT and Whisper, Ollama, ElevenLabs, and roberta-base go_emotions technologies in order to bring characters and personas to life. Make an assistant, make a friend, make a teacher--the possibilities are vast!

***CURRENT VERSION: Alpha 1.0***

## About ALTER EGO

ALTER EGO is an AI platform that transforms the way you interact with digital personas. By harnessing cutting-edge technologies in natural language processing and speech recognition, it enables you to have immersive conversations with any personalityâ€”be it historical figures, fictional characters, or entirely original creations.

---

## Features

- **Customizable Personalities**: Create and interact with AI-driven personalities that mimic the speech patterns, knowledge, and behaviors of any character you choose. Results may vary.

- **Language Model Selection**: Choose between OpenAI GPT (requires API key, per-token cost) for robust responses or Ollama (open-source, zero-cost) for budget-friendly interactions.

- **Advanced Speech Recognition**: Utilize OpenAI Whisper for accurate and real-time voice input processing.

- **Realistic Voice Generation**: Experience lifelike voice responses generated by ElevenLabs' state-of-the-art text-to-speech technology.

- **Emotion Detection and Response**: Employ the roberta-base go_emotions open-source model to detect emotional cues and generate contextually appropriate responses.

- **Dynamic Avatars**: Engage with matching avatars that visually represent the personalities, enhancing the conversational experience.

- **Seamless Integration**: Built to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new features and integration with other platforms.

## Setup

As of 1/20/2025, ALTER EGO is completely portable; if everything goes well, the program should be able to be run out of the box! Upon running the app, there will be a small popup for a setup wizard that checks for all dependencies, so do not be alarmed. The required packages and local LLM engine (Ollama) are bundled with the release, so all that is required of you, the user, is:

- **Technical Expertise**: Familiarity with language models and API integrations.
- **API Access**: Valid API keys for OpenAI and ElevenLabs (if you desire to use these features.)
- **Hardware Requirements**: A capable system that can handle the computational load, preferably with GPU support. A full breakdown of recommended hardware will come in a future update after significant testing.

Please note that for language models, you will absolutely need the setup for either OpenAI or Ollama to use the program. The API keys are not required to
run the program itself, but they are needed to run their respective services. Ollama is enabled by default regardless.

**If you have any issues with setup, please contact me or open an issue on the repository.**

## Usage

Once you have the system set up, you can start using ALTER EGO as follows:

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the main script to start the interface.

2. **Select or Create a Personality**:
   - Choose from pre-built personalities OR
   - Customize or create a new persona by defining attributes, knowledge base, and behavioral patterns.

3. **Initiate Conversation**:
   - Use your microphone to speak naturally OR
   - Type your message for the program to respond.

4. **Receive Responses**:
   - ALTER EGO generates a context-aware response using a language model.
   - The response is vocalized through ElevenLabs' voice synthesis.
   - An avatar displays appropriate expressions based on the emotional context.

5. **Continue Interaction**:
   - Engage in an ongoing dialogue.
   - The program adapts to the conversation flow and emotional cues.
